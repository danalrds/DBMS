# DBMS
work for Database Management Systems course
## Lab1
Create a C# Windows Forms application that uses ADO.NET to interact with the database you developed in the 1st semester.
The application must contain a form allowing the user to manipulate data in 2 tables that are in a 1:n relationship 
(parent table and child table). The application must provide the following functionalities: 
- display all the records in the parent table;
- when selecting a record in the parent table: 
- display all the corresponding records in the child table;
- add new child records in the child table; 
- remove / update child records in the child table. 
You must use the DataSet and SqlDataAdapter classes. You are free to use any controls on the form.
## Lab2
Transform your first laboratory to dynamically create the master-detail windows form.
The form caption, controls, form layout, stored procedures / queries used to access and manipulate data etc. shall be set 
in a configuration file.
Your form should be generic enough such that updating the application to handle some other data (still a “one to many relation”) 
comes down to updating the configuration file.
For your laboratory presentation you must create the master - child windows form and prepare at least two scenarios in which to handle
two different “one to many” relations.
How you define and interpret the configuration settings is up to you.
You must use core ADO.NET (data sets, data adapters, data readers etc.; no LINQ or Entity Framework or any other ORM framework).
